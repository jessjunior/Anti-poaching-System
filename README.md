The "97004.zip" folder contains two zipped folders: One contains files of an IoT system developed using Arduino and the other is a "KWS App" that is developed using Java.
The aim of the system is to minimize poaching such that the IoT system identifies poachers and sends alarm signals to the KWS app 
The KWS app retrieves and stores the alarm (alarm name, time and location) and displays a link to the location where the signal was sent from
The app is meant to be used by game rangers to assist them in their fight against poachers
